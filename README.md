### 💡 About Me  

💻 **Machine Learning Engineer** with a passion for crafting intelligent, data-driven solutions.  
🎓 Started with **Chemical Engineering (BSc)** and leveled up to a **Master's in Data Science, AI, and Digital Business**.  
📊 Obsessed with data – finding insights, telling stories, and transforming complexity into clarity.  
🤖 I build, test, and deploy machine learning models that solve real-world problems.  
🌟 Making data fun, meaningful, and actionable is my ultimate goal.

When I’m not wrangling data:  
🍳 Experimenting in the kitchen (putting that chemical engineering degree to good use).  
📚 Exploring sci-fi, learning new things, and on the hunt for the best ramen in Berlin.  
🚶‍♂️ Hiking trails or picking up new hobbies.
