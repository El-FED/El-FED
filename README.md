### About Me  

💻 **Machine Learning Engineer** with a passion for building cool stuff, learning, and chasing "aha!" moments.

🎓 **Chemical Engineering graduate (BSc)** now diving headfirst into the world of data with a **Master's in Data Science**. 

📊 Data enthusiast – finding the hidden gems, sharing the story they tell

🤖 Building models, breaking them (on purpose sometimes), and learning along the way.

When I’m not wrangling data:  
- Experimenting in the kitchen (putting that chemical eng. degree to good use).  
- Exploring sci-fi, learning new things
- On the hunt for the best ramen in Berlin 🍜
- Hiking trails or picking up new hobbies 🏔
